            The next chapter is the start of studies: HBO-ICT. 
            But first, let us have a look at what previously happened.

        <h2>Chemistry??</h2>
        <p>It all started with the most horrible subject at the time: chemistry. 
            I was in my third year of HAVO, having trouble with specific classes. Everything else was excellent, but chemistry was a must. 
            Being stubborn, I decided to roll into VMBO the following year. I passed my exam year without having to study at all. Suppose HAVO was the right level after all.

        <h2>IBS</h2>
        <p>After finishing my high school years, I started studying International Business Studies at MBO level. 
            The program was composed of two degrees: the Dutch MBO-4 and UK's BTEc in Business. 

            I moved to Stockholm during my last year for an internship at a software company. The 6 month were very successful and an eye-opener for me. 
            After the internship I was hired at the company. Since then I have been promoted to Business Manager.
